- write following exception subclasses of CL::Exception:
	- CL::DeviceException
	- CL::PlatformException
	- CL::ContextException
	- CL::EventException
	- CL::ProgramException
	- CL::BufferException
	- CL::KernelException
	- CL::CommandQueueException

- write generic error handler and use it in already written code.
- try to improve generic helper functions and code duplication avoidance of Object base class.
- implement correct clRetain<> and clRelease<> functionality.

Exception-Safety Guidelines:
- Throw by value. Catch by reference.
- No dynamic exception specifications. Use noexcept.
- Destructors that throw are evil.
- Use RAII (Every responsibility is an object. One per.)
- All cleanup code called from a destructor.
- Support swapperator (With No-Throw Guarantee)
- Draw "Critical Lines" for the Strong Guarantee.
- Know where to catch (Switch/Strategy/Some Success)
- Prefer exceptions to error codes.
