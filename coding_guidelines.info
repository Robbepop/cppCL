Coding Guidelines:
- indentation via TAB; filling with spaces
- one TAB indentation is equal to 4 spaces
- avoid MACROs
- prefer to stick to standard library
- use RAII everywhere where it is possible
- const correctness; especially for interfaces


Exception-Safety Guidelines:
- Throw by value. Catch by reference.
- No dynamic exception specifications. Use noexcept.
- Destructors that throw are evil.
- Use RAII (Every responsibility is an object. One per.)
- All cleanup code called from a destructor.
- Support swapperator (With No-Throw Guarantee)
- Draw "Critical Lines" for the Strong Guarantee.
- Know where to catch (Switch/Strategy/Some Success)
- Prefer exceptions to error codes.
